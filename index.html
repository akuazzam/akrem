                        My name is Akrem Azzam Ahmed, and I am a high school senior at Dandii Boru School.
                        I currently live in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with my Dad and elder sister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After high-school, I plan to go to college in the United States to study computer science.
                        I enjoy problem-solving, and I am confident that a rigorous computer science
                        curriculum will not only increase my passion for programming but also
                        equip me with the knowledge I need to solve real-life problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of school, I work part-time for Meseret Humanitarian Organization (MHO),
                        an initiative based in Addis Ababa that works primarily to reduce the vulnerability among children and women in Ethiopia.
                        Nothing motivates me more than the opportunity to directly help those in need, and I look forward to being involved in similar works in the future.  
                    </p>
